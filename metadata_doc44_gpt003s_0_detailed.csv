The issue at hand concerns the right to legal representation and assistance for individuals facing detention. The argument presented emphasizes the importance of ensuring that individuals are not deprived of their right to be heard and assisted by someone who can help them navigate the legal proceedings effectively.

Furthermore, the case raises the question of whether denying legal representation constitutes a denial of natural justice. It highlights the necessity for individuals facing detention to have the opportunity to present their case coherently with the aid of a friend or advisor, especially when they may be overwhelmed or lacking in composure due to their circumstances.

Additionally, the case discusses the right to cross-examination as a fundamental aspect of due process. It references decisions from the American Supreme Court to support the argument that individuals should have the opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses in proceedings that involve important factual determinations.

Overall, the legal issue in the case pertains to the rights of individuals facing detention, including the right to legal representation, assistance from a friend or advisor, and the right to cross-examination in order to ensure a fair and just process.","1.

Specifically, the case questions whether the appointment of priests should be restricted to a particular denomination or group as prescribed by the Agamas, which are treatises governing temple practices. The challenge arises from a long-standing practice in a temple where priests were exclusively appointed from a specific group, and the appointment of a non-member of that group was contested.

The case delves into the interpretation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution, which provide for the freedom of religion and the right of religious denominations to manage their own affairs. It examines whether the rights claimed based on caste or lineage can be protected under these constitutional provisions. The court analyzes previous decisions, including the Seshammal case, to determine the extent to which traditional practices can be upheld in the face of constitutional values, public policy, and social decency.

Ultimately, the legal issue at hand is to ascertain whether the appointment of priests in a Hindu temple can be restricted to a specific group based on traditional practices, or if such restrictions violate constitutional principles of equality, non-discrimination, and freedom of religion. The case aims to strike a balance between respecting religious customs and ensuring adherence to constitutional values and public policy.","1. The case involves a challenge by a Namboodri Brahmin to the appointment of a non-Namboodri Brahmin as a priest in a temple.
2. The challenge was based on the long-standing practice of appointing priests exclusively from Namboodri Brahmins.
3. The petitioner argued that appointing a non-Namboodri Brahmin violated the rights of Namboodri Brahmins under Article 25 and 26 of the Constitution.
4. The court considered various earlier decisions, including the decision in Adithayan, and held that rights based solely on caste cannot be protected under Article 25 and 26.
5. It was further held that barring duly qualified individuals from performing Poojas based on caste is against constitutional values and public policy.
6. The court emphasized that the issue in the case was not about exclusion based on caste, unlike in the Seshammal case.
7. The case also discussed the understanding of Hinduism and the rights of religious denominations to manage their own affairs within the limits of the law.","1. The freedom of hereditary succession to the office of Archaka is abolished, which is considered essential and integral to the faith of Saivite and Vaishnavite worshippers.
2. The government is given the authority to determine the qualifications for applicants to religious offices without clear principles outlined in the Act, leading to concerns about government interference in religious matters.

The contention is that if no public policy is at stake, an individual should be able to waive their fundamental rights, such as in matters related to tax liability. The case delves into the comparison with American law, where certain rights are protected by the Constitution but can be subject to waiver under specific circumstances. The discussion also touches upon the principles of waiver in American law, citing examples like self-incrimination, double jeopardy, immunity against unreasonable searches and seizures, jury trial, and due process of law.

The case discusses the conflict between the freedom of the press and certain orders or policies that may impede the exercise of this fundamental right. It delves into the question of whether certain restrictions, even if not explicitly defined as ""law,"" can still curtail the exercise of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

The case highlights the importance of differentiating between policies or orders that have the force of law and those that do not. It emphasizes that policies or orders, even if not formal laws, can still be justiciable if they significantly impact the exercise of fundamental rights. The discussion in the case focuses on the need to ensure that any restrictions imposed, whether through formal laws or other means, do not unduly infringe upon the freedom of speech and expression, especially in the context of the press.

Furthermore, the case underscores the critical role of the press as a pillar of democracy and emphasizes the need to safeguard the freedom of the press as a means of upholding popular sovereignty and ensuring transparency in governance. It stresses that any restrictions that hinder the press from fulfilling its role as a watchdog and a platform for public opinion need to be carefully scrutinized to prevent the erosion of fundamental rights.

In essence, the legal issue in the case revolves around the balance between governmental actions, policies, or orders and the protection of fundamental rights, particularly the freedom of speech and expression, with a specific focus on the implications for the press and its role in a democratic society.","1.

Specifically, the case discusses the impact of Article 13(1) of the Constitution on laws that were inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution.

The main question at hand is whether an existing law that became void due to its inconsistency with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution can be revived or made operative again by a subsequent constitutional amendment that removes the initial constitutional objection. The debate centers on whether the void law can regain legal force without being re-enacted after the constitutional amendment addresses the inconsistency.

The respondents argue that after a constitutional amendment removes the inconsistency, the previously void law can become operative again, even against citizens. On the other hand, the petitioners contend that a law that became void due to unconstitutionality remains dead and cannot be revived by a subsequent constitutional amendment unless it is re-enacted.

This legal issue requires a thorough examination of the interpretation of Article 13 of the Constitution, particularly the meaning of the term ""void"" as established in previous court decisions. The case delves into whether the amended clause (6) of Article 19 can have a retrospective effect on laws that were initially rendered void due to inconsistency with fundamental rights.

In essence, the legal issue in the case involves determining the effect of a constitutional amendment on laws that were invalidated for being inconsistent with the Constitution, and whether such laws can regain legal validity without being re-enacted after the constitutional objection is removed.","1.

4. Consequently, under article 13(1), the existing law became void ""to the extent of such inconsistency"".
5. The law became void only to the extent it became inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution which conferred fundamental rights.
6. The existing law did not become void independently of the existence of the rights guaranteed by Part III.
7. The impugned law continued in force for past transactions and enforcement of rights and liabilities accrued before the date of the Constitution.

3. The petitioners argued that the impugned Act was in conflict with certain provisions of the Government of India Act, 1935.
4. They also raised a question regarding the invalidity of the impugned Act even before the advent of the Constitution.
5. The Federal Court's interpretation of the word ""acquisition"" in section 299 of the Government of India Act, 1935 was cited to support their argument.

These conditions include considerations such as public order, morality, and health, as well as the State's authority to make laws regulating or restricting secular activities associated with religious practices for social welfare and reform.

Furthermore, the case delves into the responsibility of the court to determine whether a particular law infringes on religious freedom or if it is a law intended to protect the existence of the community. The court is tasked with interpreting and applying the guarantee of religious freedom to limit the legislative sphere of action and ensure the validity of laws that may affect this Fundamental Right.

The case discusses whether the right to form associations, unions, or cooperative societies guaranteed under Article 19(1)(c) is restricted to citizens only or if it can be extended to non-citizens such as corporations or companies.

The court deliberates on the concept of lifting the corporate veil to determine whether the actions of a corporation should be considered as actions of its shareholders, who are citizens, thereby potentially allowing the corporation to invoke the rights granted to citizens under Article 19(1)(c). However, the court ultimately concludes that the rights under Article 19(1)(c) are specifically guaranteed to citizens and not to non-citizens like corporations or companies. The court emphasizes that if the Constitution intended to grant these rights to corporations, it would have explicitly included them in the definition of ""citizen"" in the Citizenship Act.

Furthermore, the court highlights that the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil cannot be used to extend the rights of citizens to corporations, as it would go against the legislative intent and the clear distinction made in the Constitution between citizens and non-citizens. Therefore, the legal issue at hand is whether non-citizens, such as corporations, can claim the rights provided under Article 19(1)(c) of the Indian Constitution by invoking the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil, which the court ultimately rejects in this case.","1.

6. Changes were made to decentralize powers within the BCCI, removing the President's independent vote at General Meetings and changing the process for deciding disputes.","1. The BCCI and State Cricket Associations argued that the recommendations made by the Committee could adversely affect citizens who have formed State associations, suggesting that the court could intervene to protect the rights of these citizens.

The Act empowers the Deputy Commissioner to prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season, with penalties for contravention. The question at hand is whether this total prohibition on engaging in the business of manufacturing bidis during the agricultural season constitutes a reasonable restriction on the fundamental rights of individuals.

The contention is that the Act, under the guise of protecting public interests, interferes arbitrarily with private business and imposes unnecessarily restrictive regulations on lawful occupation. The argument is centered on whether the Act strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed under article 19 (1) (g) and the social control permitted by clause (6) of article 19. The term ""reasonable restriction"" implies that any limitation imposed on a person's enjoyment of a right should not be arbitrary or excessive, but should be in the interest of the public.

The Act's provisions are scrutinized to determine if they have a reasonable relation to the intended purpose. It is argued that the Act suspends the right to freedom of occupation and business during the agricultural seasons, potentially leading to the ruin of the industry. While restrictions on employment of agricultural labor in bidi manufacturing during the agricultural season could be reasonable, a complete stoppage of the business is deemed excessive and lacking in reasonableness.

In essence, the legal issue in the case is whether the Act's provisions, particularly the total prohibition on bidi manufacturing during the agricultural season, amount to a reasonable restriction on the fundamental rights of individuals as outlined in the Constitution. The court is tasked with evaluating whether the Act's interference with private business is justified by the public interest it seeks to protect and whether it maintains a proper balance between individual freedoms and social control.","1. The impugned Act aimed to provide measures for the supply of adequate labor for agricultural purposes in bidi manufacturing areas.
2. Sections 3 and 4 of the Act empowered the Deputy Commissioner to prohibit the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season, with penalties for contravention.
3. The Act was enacted to support the ""grow more food"" campaign and bring fallow land under cultivation.
4. The contention was that the Act imposed unreasonable and unnecessarily restrictive regulations on lawful occupation by prohibiting the manufacture of bidis during the agricultural season.
5. The question was whether the total prohibition on the business of manufacturing bidis during the agricultural season constituted a reasonable restriction on the fundamental rights under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.
6. The argument was made that the Act's provisions did not have a reasonable relation to the stated purpose and thus could not curtail the freedom of occupation and business guaranteed under the Constitution.
7. The Act was criticized for suspending the right to freedom of occupation and business during agricultural seasons, potentially leading to the ruin of the industry, instead of regulating it in a reasonable manner.
8. The Act was found to be arbitrary and excessive in its interference with private business, lacking the quality of reasonableness required for restrictions on fundamental rights.
9. The Supreme Court held that the impugned statute did not pass the test of reasonableness and was therefore deemed void, emphasizing the Court's role in safeguarding constitutional rights.","1. The impugned Act does not impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the fundamental right in the interests of the general public.
2. The provisions of the Act are in excess of the requirements of the case and the language employed is overly restrictive.
3. The Act prohibits manufacturers of bidis from employing any person in their business, regardless of where the person resides, which is deemed arbitrary.
4. The statute prohibits all persons residing in notified villages during the agricultural season from engaging in the manufacture of bidis, affecting various individuals incapable of agricultural labor.
5. The law restricts individuals from engaging in the bidi business, even if they have no connection to agricultural operations, thereby depriving them of earning their livelihood.
6. The argument that the legislature of Madhya Pradesh was the proper judge of the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the statute is countered, stating that the determination of reasonable restrictions is subject to the supervision of the Supreme Court.

The appellant contends that without such immunity, a writ could be issued to ICRISAT. However, the court's perspective is that since no writ would lie against ICRISAT, the questions regarding the grant of immunity and its impact on remedies under Article 226 do not arise.

Furthermore, the Union of India and ICRISAT argue that the notification granting immunity was issued in accordance with the March agreement between the Government and CGIAR, and that ICRISAT is not subject to the Court's jurisdiction under Article 226 as it is not a government entity and is not financially or administratively controlled by the government. They also assert that the actions taken against the appellants were in line with the procedural rules set by ICRISAT and were fair under the Industrial Employment (Standing) Orders, 1946.

Specifically, the issue concerns the abrogation or abridgment of fundamental rights and the extent to which the Parliament can amend the provisions of Part III to restrict or eliminate these rights. The case delves into the concept of the basic structure doctrine, which limits the Parliament's power to amend fundamental rights in a manner that violates the basic structure of the Constitution. Additionally, the case discusses the importance of judicial review in ensuring the constitutionality of laws and amendments that impact fundamental rights.

The unchecked and rampant exercise of power under Article 31B, with the number of laws increasing significantly, has led to the absence of constitutional control and the creation of parliamentary hegemony.
2. The absence of guidelines for the exercise of power under Article 31B results in the destruction of constitutional supremacy and limits the full power of judicial review to determine the constitutional validity of such exercises.
3. The contention that exclusion of judicial review under Article 31A does not necessarily make Ninth Schedule laws invalid, but the extent of power granted to the Legislature needs to be examined.
4. Article 31A and Article 31C provide standards for excluding laws from judicial review based on equitable distribution of resources and fundamental rights, emphasizing the special place fundamental rights hold in the Constitution.
5. The Parliament has the power to amend provisions of Part III to abridge or take away fundamental rights, but this power is subject to the limitation of the basic structure doctrine.
6. The impact of amendments on fundamental rights, such as freedom of the press, must be examined to ensure they do not violate the basic structure of the Constitution.

Additionally, the case examines the State's responsibility to uplift backward classes, promote social and educational advancement, and address the needs of weaker sections of society through special programs and policies. The court is called upon to assess whether these objectives can be achieved through race-conscious measures or religiously motivated programs, and whether such practices are in line with the intentions of the framers of the Constitution.

Legitimate expectation is a principle that requires regularity, predictability, and certainty in government dealings with the public. It has both procedural and substantive aspects. Procedurally, legitimate expectation arises when an administrative decision affects a person by depriving them of a benefit or advantage they have been permitted to enjoy in the past and can legitimately expect to continue unless rational grounds for withdrawal have been communicated to them. Substantively, legitimate expectation involves representations made by the decision-maker regarding the granting or continuation of a benefit of a substantive nature.

In the case discussed, the issue of legitimate expectation was raised by the respondents who contended that they should receive a certain increase in allowance based on their revised scales. However, the National Building Construction Corporation (NBCC) rejected their claim based on the peculiar conditions under which they were working in Iraq. The court examined the doctrine of legitimate expectation in this context and emphasized that claims based on legitimate expectation require reliance on representations made by the decision-maker and a resulting detriment, similar to claims based on promissory estoppel. The court clarified that the principle of legitimate expectation is developed within the framework of reasonableness and natural justice.

Ultimately, the court found that the principles of legitimate expectation did not apply to the facts of the case and ruled that the appeal lacked merit and should be dismissed.","1. The appellant relied on various decisions to support their claim, emphasizing the need for compensation due to termination of appointment.
2. The State of Rajasthan argued that there was no Cabinet decision supporting the appellant's claim and that termination was based on legislative action.
3. The State contended that specific statutes already provided for compensation in similar cases, making the principles of legitimate expectation inapplicable.
4. The dispute centered around the interpretation of Article 166 of the Constitution, which mandates that all executive actions of the State Government must be in the name of the Governor.
5. The appellant's argument regarding Clause (2) of Article 310 was that compensation should be paid for premature termination of contractual service, but the State disagreed, stating that the clause is only enabling and does not mandate compensation unless specified in the contract.
6. The State maintained that the provision for compensation must be explicitly stated in the contract and cannot be implied.","1. The appellant argued that a Cabinet decision was made to release salary for the balance period of his tenure appointment, which he claimed was enforceable.
2. It was contended that even though there was no contractual provision for compensation, it should be considered an inherent requirement based on the spirit of Article 310(2) of the Constitution.
3. The appellant claimed that there was a violation of his legitimate expectation to continue until the end of his tenure period, and therefore, the State Government was obligated to pay compensation regardless of the existence of a previous Cabinet decision.","Shivaraj V.

The case delves into the relationship between these two parts of the Constitution and the obligations they impose on the State. It discusses how the Constitution aims to achieve a balance between securing individual rights and promoting social, economic, and political justice for the citizens.

Furthermore, the case addresses the amendment brought about by the 42nd Amendment, which subordinates fundamental rights conferred by Articles 14 and 19 to the directive principles. This raises the fundamental question of how to reconcile the competing claims of individual rights and the broader societal goals outlined in the Directive Principles of State Policy.

The court's analysis focuses on the core principles of the Constitution, emphasizing the need to maintain harmony and balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. It underscores that the rights conferred by Part III are not standalone but are means to achieve the ends specified in Part IV. The judgment highlights the interdependence of these two parts and how any imbalance between them would undermine the basic structure of the Constitution.

The case discusses the amendments made to Articles 14, 15, and 16 of the Indian Constitution, particularly focusing on reservation provisions for Socially and Economically Backward Classes. The key question at hand is whether these amendments alter the basic structure of the Constitution, especially in terms of equality and reservation policies.

The case delves into the criteria for reservation, emphasizing the importance of identifying and measuring backwardness, inadequacy of representation, and overall administrative efficiency. It highlights that these factors are context-specific and must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The judgment stresses that the amendments do not remove the limitations set by the Constitution regarding reservation policies.

Furthermore, the case addresses the concern that the amendments were introduced to overrule previous decisions of the court. It clarifies that the pronouncements of the Supreme Court are the law of the land under Article 141 of the Constitution and that any changes to established legal principles must be carefully examined. The judgment emphasizes that the amendments are enabling in nature, leaving it to the states to implement reservation policies within the framework provided by the Constitution.

Overall, the legal issue in the case involves analyzing whether the amendments to reservation provisions maintain the fundamental principles of equality, justice, and efficiency as outlined in the Constitution, without altering the basic structure of the law.","1.

3. An Office Memorandum in 1990 reserved 27% of civil post vacancies for Socially and Economically Backward Classes.
4. A subsequent Office Memorandum in 1991 specified that within the 27% reservation, preference should be given to candidates from poorer sections of the Backward Classes.
5. The case discussed the criteria of ""backwardness"" and ""inadequacy of representation"" as essential for reservation.
6. It emphasized that equity, justice, and efficiency are variable factors, dependent on the specific circumstances of each case.
7. The judgment highlighted that the State must correctly identify and measure backwardness and inadequacy for reservation to be valid.
8. The amendments discussed in the case did not alter the core structure of Articles 14, 15, and 16 of the Constitution.
9. The amendments were seen as enabling in nature, leaving it to the States to provide for reservation within the parameters set by the Constitution.
10. The case affirmed that the pronouncements of the Supreme Court are the law of the land and any legislative changes must adhere to these pronouncements.","1. The learned Attorney General argued for the reconsideration of Nagaraj (supra) on two main points:
2. Firstly, he contended that the requirement for the State to collect quantifiable data on backwardness, as stated in Nagaraj (supra), contradicts the judgment in Indra Sawhney (1), which presumes Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as the most backward without needing to prove it again.
3. Secondly, he highlighted that the creamy layer concept was not applied to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Indra Sawhney (1), and Nagaraj (supra) incorrectly applied this concept to them.
4. The Attorney General also argued that Nagaraj (supra) did not provide a test for determining adequacy of representation in service, proposing that the proportion of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes to the population in India at all promotion stages should be the test, utilizing the roster from R.K. Sabharwal v. State of Punjab.
5. Other counsel, including Ms. Indira Jaising, supported revisiting Nagaraj (supra) on the grounds that Article 16(4-A) and 16(4-B) do not stem from Article 16(4) but from Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution, and that any further sub-classification within Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is impermissible as per previous judgments.
6. The argument was made that Nagaraj (supra) could potentially amend the Presidential Order related to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, violating the exclusive amendment power of Parliament under Articles 341 and 342 of the Constitution.

This issue is being debated in light of the M. Nagaraj case and the arguments put forth by different parties regarding the prospective applicability of the law laid down in that case.

They claim that these rules have the force of law and that the terminations were done without proper legal authority.

Furthermore, the employees challenge the view that the service rules governing them do not have statutory force and are merely contractual in nature.

The applicant is seeking clarification on the impact of a previous court judgment on certain provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Armed Forces Acts. The applicant argues that while the court found a specific section of the Indian Penal Code unconstitutional, there is a concern that this judgment may be misconstrued to nullify the relevance of provisions within the Armed Forces Acts that govern the conduct of armed forces personnel. The applicant highlights Article 33 of the Constitution, which allows Parliament to modify certain rights conferred by the Constitution in their application to members of the Armed Forces to ensure discipline and proper discharge of duties.

The applicant contends that there is a misconception that the court's previous judgment renders the provisions of the Armed Forces Acts irrelevant, even if a case is made under those provisions. The applicant, represented by the learned Additional Solicitor General, emphasizes specific provisions of the Army Act, 1950, to illustrate the potential conflict between the court's judgment and the statutory provisions governing the armed forces.

In essence, the legal issue at hand is the need for clarification regarding the interplay between a court judgment declaring a section of the Indian Penal Code unconstitutional and the statutory provisions under the Armed Forces Acts that regulate the conduct of armed forces personnel. The applicant seeks to ensure that the judgment does not inadvertently undermine the applicability and enforcement of the provisions within the Armed Forces Acts.","1. The applicant is seeking clarification of a judgment by the Court regarding the constitutionality of Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
2. The applicant argues that officers of the Armed forces are subject to statutory provisions under the Army Act, 1950, Navy Act, 1957, and the Air Force Act, 1950.
3. Article 33 of the Constitution allows Parliament to restrict or abrogate certain rights conferred by the Constitution on members of the Armed Forces to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline.
4. The applicant believes that the judgment being clarified may give the impression that nothing more would survive even if a case is made under the relevant provisions of the Acts in question.
5. The Court clarified that the judgment in question was solely concerned with the validity of Section 497 IPC and Section 198 Cr.P.C., finding them unconstitutional based on Articles 14, 15, and 21 of the Constitution.
6. The Court did not consider the effect and operation of the relevant provisions in the Acts related to the Armed Forces, such as Sections 45 and 63 of the 1950 Act, as it was not within the scope of the judgment being clarified.","1. Applications for ""clarification,"" ""modification,"" or ""recall"" are sometimes used as a way to bypass the review process and obtain a hearing in open court.
2. The court should not permit hearings for such applications if they are essentially review applications in disguise.
3. Judicial pronouncements are meant to be stable and final, discouraging repeated applications seeking modification or clarification after a judgment has been pronounced.
4. Filing miscellaneous applications to seek modification or clarification of a judgment is not legally supported and goes against the finality of judicial decisions.","K.M. Joseph, Ajay Rastogi, Aniruddha Bose, Hrishikesh Roy, C.T. Ravikumar",Joseph Shine,Union of India Secretary

The case involves a judgment delivered on behalf of four Judges that recognized the impact of Article 14 in determining whether a law violates Article 21.
2. The evolution of Article 21 since a previous decision indicates two major areas of change, emphasizing that fundamental rights are interconnected and that Article 14 influences Article 21.
3. The expression ""procedure established by law"" in Article 21 is not merely a formalistic requirement but involves both procedural and substantive reasonableness.
4. The Court highlighted the liberal predicament where the state must remain neutral towards different views in a plural society, balancing potentially conflicting rights based on a legitimate idea of justice.
5. The case involved the balancing of two facets of an individual's dignity - personal autonomy and leading a dignified life, especially in the context of state welfare schemes.
6. The Court emphasized the importance of balancing autonomy and economic benefits in state actions, ensuring that there is no undue intrusion into autonomy under the guise of providing economic benefits.

These issues are considered to be overlapping and may require a larger bench to ensure an authoritative and consistent approach in addressing them. Additionally, the case raises questions about the jurisdiction of courts in matters related to religion and religious practices, emphasizing the need for caution when deciding on such issues. The conflict between the role of the court in determining essential religious practices of a denomination and leaving such determinations to the denomination itself is highlighted, indicating a need for further consideration by a larger bench.","1.

Arguments were made regarding the exclusion of women between the ages of 10 to 50 from a temple based on the celibacy vow of the deity rather than menstruation being considered polluting.
2. An extreme argument was presented suggesting that since worshippers from all faiths visit Sabarimala, it cannot be considered a Hindu temple. This argument was refuted by comparing it to a Christian church allowing worshippers of all faiths.
3. It was argued that gender restrictions in other places of worship have not been interfered with and are considered essential religious practices. This argument was deemed vague and not suitable for a review.
4. Some petitioners claimed that a previous Division Bench judgment should be considered res judicata, as it addressed similar issues. However, the court discussed the application of res judicata in public interest litigations.","1. D.Y. Chandrachud

The key question is whether the two-fold classification based on type and territory adopted in the Ordinance, along with the notification issued under it, is reasonable and valid under the principles of equal protection guaranteed by the law. The court needs to determine if the classification and the resulting disparity in treatment are justified by the objective of combating regional crime and maintaining public peace, without exceeding what the situation demands.

3. Disparity in treatment due to differing procedures is not discriminatory unless it goes beyond what is necessary for a fair trial.
4. Article 14 provides constitutional protection against discriminatory procedural laws, ensuring a fair and impartial trial.
5. The impugned Ordinance in the case was passed to combat increasing regional crime, justifying the two-fold classification based on type and territory as reasonable and valid.

8. The absence of a rational classification in the Ordinance, particularly regarding the establishment of a Special Court and treatment of cognate offences, was a point of contention.
9. The negation of committal proceedings was highlighted as a significant issue for the accused, affecting their ability to challenge evidence and potentially leading to unfair treatment.

Specifically, the question is whether the provisions of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, under which the appellant was being prosecuted, were rendered void by being inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.

The appellant argued that certain sections of the Act were void due to their inconsistency with Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression. The appellant contended that since the Constitution came into force during the pendency of the prosecution, the case against him could not proceed based on these allegedly void sections of the Act.

The High Court, in its decision, assumed that the provisions of the Act challenged by the appellant were indeed inconsistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The High Court held that Article 13(1) of the Constitution had the effect of repealing such inconsistent provisions of existing laws. However, the High Court also noted that pending proceedings were not affected by this repeal, citing Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, which is applicable for interpreting the Constitution.

Ultimately, the legal issue in the case was whether the provisions of the Indian Press (Emergency Powers) Act, 1931, were void due to their inconsistency with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and if so, whether this rendered the prosecution against the appellant invalid.","1.

The contention is that the finality clause, by itself, is not enough to preclude the extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Courts and the plenary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.

Specifically, the issue concerns the right of a government servant to receive the report of the Inquiry Officer and to represent against the findings recorded in it when the Inquiry Officer is not the disciplinary authority. This right was traditionally exercised at the stage when the employee was served with a notice to show cause against the proposed penalty.

The crux of the legal issue is the interconnection between the right to receive the Inquiry Officer's report, the right to represent against the findings in the report, and the right to show cause against the proposed penalty. Prior to the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution, these rights arose simultaneously when a notice to show cause against the proposed penalty was issued. If the disciplinary authority decided not to impose a penalty of dismissal, removal, or reduction in rank after considering the Inquiry Officer's report, there was no requirement to issue a notice to show cause against the proposed penalty.

The legal issue delves into the intricacies of when and how these rights are triggered in disciplinary proceedings involving government servants, emphasizing the importance of natural justice, reasonable opportunity, and the procedural fairness owed to individuals facing disciplinary actions.","1. The case involves a delinquent officer who was provided with all materials and given an opportunity to make representations during an enquiry conducted by a fact-finding authority.
2. The report of the enquiry did not contain any additional information beyond what was already supplied to the delinquent officer.
3. The principle of natural justice was discussed, emphasizing that it cannot be rigidly applied in a uniform manner and must be considered based on the specific facts of each case.
4. Various legal cases and amendments were referenced to highlight the importance of providing the delinquent officer with a copy of the enquiry report before the disciplinary authority considers the material and decides on the proof of charge and the nature of the punishment to be imposed.
5. Non-compliance with providing the copy of the enquiry report was deemed as a denial of reasonable opportunity, violating constitutional articles and the principles of natural justice.
6. The discussion also touched upon the implications of the 42nd Amendment Act on the rights of the delinquent officer in terms of hearing before the disciplinary authority on proof of charge or penalty.
7. The disciplinary authority was noted to have the responsibility to consider and impose a proper penalty based on factors such as the gravity of misconduct, impact on discipline, and previous conduct of the individual.","1. The argument presented was regarding the retrospective application of legal principles, specifically whether a new legal ruling should be applied to past cases or only to future cases.
2. It was debated whether the benefits of a new legal ruling should extend to parties whose cases had already been finalized, were pending trial, or in appeal.
3. The discussion included considerations such as the reliance on the previous legal framework by the administration, the practicality of implementing the new rule without causing injustice, and the impact on the administration of justice.
4. The argument also touched upon the distinction between civil and criminal cases, as well as the application of new legal rules to constitutional, statutory, or common law rights.
5. The decision-making process was highlighted as a matter of judicial policy, not constitutional compulsion, with each case evaluated based on its individual merits and circumstances.","1. M.N. Venkatachaliah

The key questions raised include whether the legislation is overbroad or void in part, the justification for immobilizing the passport without clear reasons provided to the petitioner, and the potential violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 21, 19, and 14 of the Constitution. Specifically, the focus is on whether the impugned section of the Passports Act, especially Section 10(3)(c), infringes on constitutional rights and if it can be circumscribed to align with the Constitution. Additionally, the legality of the impounding order in relation to the overall validity of the Passports Act is under scrutiny. The case delves into the interplay between personal liberty, the right to travel abroad, and the procedural safeguards established by law, emphasizing the need to ensure that any restrictions on personal liberty are within constitutional limits and do not unduly infringe on fundamental rights.","- The case involved a State action related to newsprint policy.
- The policy imposed a maximum limit of ten pages for every newspaper.
- Newspapers were not allowed to increase the number of pages by reducing circulation to meet the limit.","1. Impounding a passport without giving the holder a reasonable opportunity to be heard violates the principle of fairness and justice.
2. The petitioner argued that impounding a passport restricts the constitutional right to travel abroad and should not be done without following the principle of audi alteram partem.
3. While the Passports Act, 1967 does not explicitly require a hearing before impounding a passport, the absence of such a provision does not conclusively settle the matter.
4. The law may imply the need for a hearing even when not explicitly stated in the statute, as established by legal precedents.
5. The argument is centered around the fairness and justness of the procedure for impounding passports, emphasizing the importance of providing an opportunity for the passport holder to present their case before such a significant action is taken.","1. M. Hameedullah Beg

The State Government aims to control these institutions for socio-political reasons, while the institutions themselves desire to have functional control in the best interests of the students. The dispute arises from the State's desire to regulate these institutions versus the private institutions' desire for autonomy in running their establishments.

The central legal question is whether the provisions in the Act and Rules infringe upon the rights of educational institutions to admit students. This issue is analyzed in light of Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to establish and manage educational institutions as a fundamental right. However, this right is not absolute and can be subject to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6) in the interest of the general public.

The doctrine of proportionality is applied to determine the reasonableness of restrictions imposed on the exercise of rights under Article 19(1)(g). The court must strike a balance between fundamental rights and the larger interests of society, considering factors such as the purpose of the restriction, extent of restriction, and Directive Principles of State Policy. The State's authority to regulate education to promote merit, excellence, and curb malpractices is acknowledged, as long as it is done in the interest of the student community and does not violate fundamental rights.

In summary, the legal issue in the case involves the tension between the State's regulatory authority over private educational institutions and the institutions' rights to autonomy in managing their affairs, particularly in the context of admissions and student welfare. The court must determine the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the State to ensure a balance between individual rights and the broader societal interests in education.","1. The case involves a challenge to the constitutional validity of the Act, 2007 along with Rules, 2008 and Rules, 2009.
2. The dispute revolves around the control of private medical colleges by the State Government and the desire of institutions to have functional control for the benefit of students.
3. There is a conflict of interest between State Governments wanting control for socio-political reasons and private institutions seeking autonomy to provide quality education.
4. Private medical colleges play a significant role in imparting medical education due to the lack of sufficient funds with the State to provide top-notch infrastructure.
5. The case reflects a shift from complete Government control over education to a scenario where private institutions are allowed to operate under a regulatory framework.
6. Education is considered an 'occupation' and a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution, with restrictions in place to prevent profiteering and ensure admissions are merit-based.
7. The State's liberalization policy allows for the establishment of private educational institutions, emphasizing quality education within a regulated framework.","1. The tension between the rights of individuals and the limitations imposed by statutes is a fundamental aspect of democracy.
2. The resolution of this tension is achieved through proper balancing of competing principles, allowing each facet to develop harmoniously.
3. The concept of 'proportionality' is introduced as a criterion for balancing rights and limitations imposed by laws.
4. Chief Justice Dickson of Canada outlines the criteria for determining the reasonableness and justification of limitations on constitutional rights.
5. The discussion in the case revolves around the conflict of interest between State Governments and private institutions regarding control over medical colleges.

The High Court initially struck down a government proceeding that decided not to provide reservations in promotions without quantifiable data on the backwardness or representation of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. However, upon review, the High Court modified its decision, citing the obligation of the State to collect quantifiable data on the inadequacy of representation of these groups in public services before deciding on reservations. The High Court emphasized that Article 16(4) and 16(4-A) of the Constitution are enabling provisions, not mandates, for providing reservations. The State was directed to gather data within a specified timeframe to make an informed decision on whether to implement reservations in promotions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Additionally, the case delves into the interpretation of previous judgments related to reservation policies and the legal implications of government actions in response to court decisions.","1. The High Court judgment in Writ Petition No.117 of 2019 stated that the Government of Uttarakhand's decision to fill promotional posts without providing reservations to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was struck down.

The concern is that these clauses, specifically clauses (4) and (5), are considered arbitrary and are seen as damaging or destroying the rule of law. The argument presented is that the constituent power did not have any law to apply to the case in question, leading to a violation of the rule of law contained in the Constitution, particularly Article 14. The contention is that deciding a case without applying any law would be arbitrary and would violate the principle of equality before the law.

Furthermore, the discussion delves into the concept of the rule of law, emphasizing the importance of the absence of arbitrary power and equality before the law. The rule of law is seen as a dynamic concept that should safeguard and advance the political and civil rights of individuals in a free society. The denial of equality, as per the judicially evolved theory of classification, is considered a negation of the rule of law.

Additionally, the doctrine of arbitrariness is highlighted as a basis for challenging state action that violates the rule of law contained in Article 14. The doctrine of arbitrariness is seen as an extension of the principles of absence of arbitrary power and equality before the law. State actions can be struck down if they are found to be arbitrary and in violation of the rule of law.

In summary, the legal issue in the case pertains to the constitutionality of clauses (4) and (5) of Article 329-A, which are deemed arbitrary and damaging to the rule of law, particularly in relation to the principles of applying laws and ensuring equality before the law.","1.

2. State actions must be fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory, transparent, non-capricious, unbiased, without favoritism or nepotism, in pursuit of healthy competition and equitable treatment.
3. Constitutional infirmities must be tested for in State actions, and if found, Article 14 will interdict such infirmity.
4. The doctrine of arbitrariness is a distinct doctrine on which State action may be struck down as violative of the rule of law contained in Article 14.
