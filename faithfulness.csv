In State of West Bengal v. Subodh Gopal [1954] S.C.R. 587, 596. Patanjali Sastri, J. said that\narticle (Article 19) enumerates certain freedoms under the caption ""right to freedom"" and deals with\nthose great and basic rights which are recognized and guaranteed as the natural rights inherent in\nthe status of a citizen of a free country. 1740. In the United States of America, reliance upon natural\nlaw on the part of vested interests inimical to the economic freedom of man was destined to prove a\npersistent feature in the 19th century. In the second half of the 19th century, the ideas of natural law\nand of natural rights were resorted to in an attempt to curb State interference with rights of private\nproperty and freedom of contract. The ideas of natural law and natural rights were revived and\nendowed with fresh vigour for that purpose See Haines, ""The Revival of Natural Law Concepts"", pp.\n117-123. By reference to natural rights of man, Courts in the United States often declared to be\nunConstitutional legislation for securing humane conditions of work, for protecting the employment\nof women and children, for safeguarding the interests of consumers, and for controlling the powers\nof trusts and corporations. This past history explains why natural rights have been regarded in some\nquarters with suspicion and why writers affirming the supremacy of a higher law over the legislature\nor the Constitution have spoken with impatience of the damnosa hereditas of natural rights. This\nidea of natural law in defence of causes both paltry and iniquitous has caused many to reject it with\nimpatience. A great practical reformer like Jeremy Bentham, a great judge like Mr. Justice Holmes\nand a great legal philosopher like Hans Kelsen-all believers in social progress-have treated the law of\nnature with little respect and have rejected it as fiction. Mr. Justice Holmes remarked : ""The jurists\nwho believe in natural law seem to me to be in that naive state of mind that accepts what has been\nfamiliar and accepted by them and their neighbours as something that must be accepted by all men\neverywhere"" Holmes, ""Collected Legal Papers"", p. 312. Professor Kelsen considers the typical\nfunction of the natural law school to have been the defence of established authority and\ninstitutions-of established governments, of private property, of slavery, of marriage See Kelsen,\n""General Theory of Law and State"", pp. 413-418. 1741. Despite these attacks and the ebb and flow in\nits fortune, there has been a revival of the law of nature in the 20th century and there is no\ngainsaying the fact that the doctrine of the law of nature was the bulwark and the lever of the idea of\nthe rights of mare embodied in the International Bill of Human Rights with a view to make the\nrecognition of these rights more effective and to proclaim to the world that no State should violate\nthese rights See Lauterpacht, ""International Law and Human Rights"", pp. 112-113. Whether you call\nthese rights, natural rights or not, whether they flow from the law of nature or not, as I said, these\nare rights which belong to man as a rational and moral being. ""Man\'s only right, in the last analysis\nis the right to be a man, to live as a human person.

A moral or natural right is an interest\nrecognized and protected by a rule of morality- an interest the violation of which\nwould be a moral wrong, and respect for which is a moral duty. A legal right, on the\nother hand, is an interest recognized and protected by a rule of law-an interest the\nviolation of which would be a legal wrong done to him whose interest it is, and\nrespect for which is a legal duty.\nBentham set the fashion still followed by many of denying that there are any such\nthings as natural rights at all. All rights are legal rights and the creation of the law.\n\'Natural law, natural rights\', he says, \'are two kinds of fictions or metaphors, which\nplay so great a part in books of legislation, that they deserve to be examined by\nthemselves.... Rights properly so called are the creatures of law properly so called;\nreal laws give rise to real rights. Natural rights are the creatures of natural law; they\nare a metaphor which derives its origin from another metaphor.\' Yet the claim that\nmen have natural rights need not involve us in a theory of natural law. In so far as we\naccept rules and principles of morality prescribing how men ought to behave, we may\nspeak of there being moral or natural rights; and in so far as these rules lay down that\nmen have certain rights, we may speak of moral or natural rights. The fact that such\nnatural or moral rights and duties are not prescribed in black and white like their\nlegal counterparts points to a distinction between law and morals; it does not entail\nthe complete non-existence of moral rights and duties. (see p. 218-219). 1513. The\nobservations on page 61 of P.W. Peterson\'s ""Natural Law and Natural Rights"" show\nthat the theory of natural rights which was made so popular by John Locke has since\nceased to receive general acceptance. Locke had propounded the theory that the\ncommunity perpetually retains a supreme power of saving themselves from the\nattempts and designs of anybody, even of their legislators whenever they shall be so\nfoolish or so wicked as to lay and carry on designs against the liberties and properties\nof the subject (see Principles of Civil Government Book 2 S 149).\n1514. While dealing with natural rights, Roscoe Pound states on page 500 of Vol. I of\nhis Jurisprudence:\nPerhaps nothing contributed so much to create and foster hostility to courts and law\nand Constitutions as this conception of the courts as guardians of individual natural\nrights against the state and against society; this conceiving of the law as a final and\nabsolute body of doctrine declaring these individual natural rights; this theory of\nConstitutions as declaratory of common-law principles, which are also natural-law\nprinciples, anterior to the state and of superior validity to enactments by the\nauthority of the state; this theory of Constitutions as having for their purpose to\nguarantee and maintain the natural rights of individuals against the government and\nall its agencies.

"[""122. In the light of the above authorities, it has to be determined whether the practice of exclusion of\nwomen of the age group of 10 to 50 years is equivalent to a doctrine of Hindu religion or a practice\nthat could be regarded as an essential part of the Hindu religion and whether the nature of Hindu\nreligion would be altered without the said exclusionary practice. The answer to these questions, in\nour considered opinion, is in the firm negative. In no scenario, it can be said that exclusion of\nwomen of any age group could be regarded as an essential practice of Hindu religion and on the\ncontrary, it is an essential part of the Hindu religion to allow Hindu women to enter into a temple as\ndevotees and followers of Hindu religion and offer their prayers to the deity. In the absence of any\nscriptural or textual evidence, we cannot accord to the exclusionary practice followed at the\nSabarimala temple the status of an essential practice of Hindu religion.\n123. By allowing women to enter into the Sabarimala temple for offering prayers, it cannot be\nimagined that the nature of Hindu religion would be fundamentally altered or changed in any\nmanner. Therefore, the exclusionary practice, which has been given the backing of a subordinate\nlegislation in the form of Rule 3(b) of the 1965 Rules, framed by the virtue of the 1965 Act, is neither\nan essential nor an integral part of the Hindu religion without which Hindu religion, of which the\ndevotees of Lord Ayyappa are followers, will not survive.\n124. Nobody can say that essential part or practice of one's religion has changed from a particular\ndate or by an event. Such alterable parts or practices are definitely not the 'core' of religion where\nthe belief is based and religion is founded upon. It could only be treated as mere embellishments to\nthe non-essential part or practices.\n125. This view of ours is further substantiated by the fact that where a practice changes with the\nefflux of time, such a practice cannot, in view of the law laid down in Commissioner of Police and\nothers (supra), be regarded as a core upon which a religion is formed. There has to be unhindered\ncontinuity in a practice for it to attain the status of essential practice. It is further discernible from\nthe judgment of the High Court in S. Mahendran (supra) that the Devaswom Board had accepted\nbefore the High Court that female worshippers of the age group of 10 to 50 years used to visit the\ntemple and conduced poojas in every month for five days for the first rice feeding ceremony of their\nchildren. The Devaswom Board also took a stand before the High Court that restriction of entry for\nwomen was only during Mandalam, Makaeavilakku and Vishnu days. The same has also been\npointed out by learned Senior Counsel, Ms. Indira Jaising, that the impugned exclusionary practice\nin question is a 'custom with some aberrations' as prior to the passing of the Notification in 1950,\nwomen of all age groups used to visit the Sabarimala temple for the first rice feeding ceremony of\ntheir children.\n126. Therefore, there seems to be no continuity in the exclusionary practice followed at the\nSabarimala temple and in view of this, it cannot be treated as an essential practice. Analysis of the\n1965 Act and Rule 3(b) of the 1965 Rules\n127. We may presently deal with the statutory provisions of the Kerala Hindu Places of Public\nWorship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965. Section 2 of the said Act is the definition clause and\nreads as under:Indian Young Lawyers Association vs The State Of Kerala on 28 September, 2018\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163639357/ 32"", '50 Is the practice of excluding women between the ages of ten and fifty from undertaking the\npilgrimage and praying at the Sabarimala temple an essential part of religion? The texts and tenets\non which the Respondents placed reliance do not indicate that the practice of excluding women is an\nessential part of religion required or sanctioned by these religious documents. At best, these\ndocuments indicate the celibate nature of Lord Ayyappa at the Sabarimala temple. The connection\nbetween this and the exclusion of women is not established on the material itself.\n51 It was briefly contended that the case at hand required a determination of fact and law and\nshould be sent to trial. It was contended that no new material has been placed before this Court to\ncontradict the holding of the Kerala High Court in Mahendran. The High Court recorded findings on\nthe pilgrimage, the inconsistent practice of prohibiting women between the age group of ten and\nPART G fifty, and the collection of individuals that offer prayer at the Sabarimala temple. Relying on\nthe findings of fact recorded in Mahendran and taking note of the submissions of the Respondents\nherein, the question of remanding the case to a trial in this case does not arise.\nIn regard to the maintainability of the present public interest litigation, this issue stands answered\nby the judgment of this Court in Adi Saiva Sivachariyargal v Government of Tamil Nadu,47 :\n□12€The argument that the present writ petition is founded on a cause relating to\nappointment in a public office and hence not entertainable as a public interest\nlitigation would be too simplistic a solution to adopt to answer the issues that have\nbeen highlighted which concerns the religious faith and practice of a large number of\ncitizens of the country and raises claims of century-old traditions and usage having\nthe force of law. The above is the second ground, namely, the gravity of the issues\nthat arise, that impel us to make an attempt to answer the issues raised and arising in\nthe writ petitions for determination on the merits thereof.‚ (Emphasis supplied) Of\nimportance are some of the observations of the Kerala High Court in Mahendran The\nHigh Court noted that even when old customs prevailed, women were allowed to visit\nthe Temple.48 It noted an incident where the Maharaja of Travancore, accompanied\nby the Maharani and the Divan, had visited the Temple in 1115 M.E. The High Court\nnoted that the Temple has seen the presence of women worshippers between the ages\nof ten and fifty for the 47 (2016) 2 SCC 725 48 Ibid, at para 7 PART G first\nrice-feeding ceremony of their children.49 The Secretary of the Ayyappa Seva\nSangham had deposed that young women were seen in Sabarimala during the\nprevious ten to fifteen years.50 A former Devaswom Commissioner admitted that the\nfirst rice-feeding ceremony of her grandchild was conducted at the Sabarimala\nTemple. The High Court found that during the twenty years preceding the decision,\nwomen irrespective of age were allowed to visit the temple when it opened for\nmonthly poojas,51 but were prohibited from entering the temple only during\nMandalam, Makaravilakku and Vishu seasons.52 The High Court thus noted multiple\ninstances wherein women were allowed to pray at the Sabarimala temple. These\nobservations demonstrate that the practice of excluding women from the Sabarimala\ntemple was not uniform. This militates against a claim that such a practice is of an\nobligatory nature. That such practice has not been followed on numerous occasions,Indian Young Lawyers Association vs The State Of Kerala on 28 September, 2018\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163639357/ 109']","The court determines whether the exclusion of women of a certain age group at the Sabarimala temple is an essential practice under Hindu religion by examining whether this practice is supported by scriptural or textual evidence. Additionally, the court considers whether the exclusionary practice is consistent and continuous over time, as essential practices in religion are expected to maintain unhindered continuity. The court also evaluates whether allowing women to enter the temple would fundamentally alter the nature of Hindu religion. Based on these factors, the court concludes that the exclusion of women from the Sabarimala temple is not an essential practice of Hindu religion as it lacks scriptural support, continuity, and does not impact the fundamental nature of the religion.",True,YES,1.0,False

In this state of the pleadings, we must come to the\nconclusion that though the list is prepared caste-wise, the castes included therein are as a whole\neducationally and socially backward and therefore the list is not violate of Art. 15.

In determining whether a\nparticular section forms a class, caste cannot be excluded altogether. But in the determination of a\nclass a test solely based upon the caste or community cannot also be accepted. By cl. (1) Art. 15\nprohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste,\nsex, place of birth or any of them. By cl. (3) of Art. 15 the State is, notwithstanding the provision\ncontained in cl. (1), permitted to make special provision for women and children. By cl. (4) a special\nprovision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is outside the purview of cl. (1). But cl. (4) is an\nexception to cl. (1). Being an exception, it cannot be extended so as in effect to destroy the guarantee\nof cl. (1). The Parliament has by enacting cl. (4) attempted to balance as against the right of equality\nof citizens the special necessities of the weaker sections of the people by allowing a provision to be\nmade for their advancement. In order that effect may be given to cl.

We would also like to\nmake it clear that if in a given situation caste is excluded in ascertaining a class\nwithin the meaning of Art. 15(4) of the Constitution, it does not vitiate the\nclassification if it satisfied other tests.\n3. Minor P. Rajendran v State of Madras (1968 (2) SCR 787) ""The first challenge is to r. 5 on the\nground that it violates Art. 15 of the Constitution. Article 15 forbids discrimination against any\ncitizen on the grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. At the same\ntime Art. 15(4) inter alia permits the State to make any special provision for the advancement of any\nsocially and educationally backward classes of citizens. The contention is that the list of socially and\neducationally backward classes for whom reservation is made under r. 5 is nothing but a list of\ncertain castes. Therefore, reservation in favour of certain castes based only on caste considerations\nviolates Art. 15(1), which prohibits discrimination on the ground o caste only. Now if the reservation\nin question had been based only on caste and had not taken into account the social and educational\nbackwardness of the caste in question, it would be violative of Art. 15(1). But it must not be forgotten\nthat a caste is also a class of citizens and if the caste as a whole is socially and educationally\nbackward reservation can be made in favour of such a caste on the ground that it is a socially and\neducationally backward class of citizens within the meaning of Art. 15(4). Reference in this\nconnection may be made to the observations of this Court in M. R. Balaji v. State of Mysore ([1963]\nSupp. 1 S.C.R. 439 at p. 459-460) to the effect that it was not irrelevant to consider the caste of a\nclass of citizens in determining their social and educational backwardness. It was further observed\nthat though the caste of a class of citizens may be relevant its importance should not be exaggerated;\nand if classification of backward classes of citizens was based solely on the caste of the citizen, it\nmight be open to objection. It is true that in the present cases the list of socially and educationally\nbackward classes has been specified by caste. But that does not necessarily mean that caste was the\nsole consideration and that persons belonging to these castes are also not a class of socially and\neducationally backward citizens. In its reply, the State of Madras has given the history as to how this\nlist of backward classes was made, starting from the year 1906 and how the list has been kept upto\ndate and necessary amendments made therein. It has also been stated that the main criterion for\ninclusion in the list was the social and educational backwardness of the caste based on occupations\npursued by these castes. Because the members of the caste as a whole were found to be socially and\neducationally backward, they were put in the list. The matter was finally examined after the\nConstitution came into force in the light of the provisions contained in Art. 15(4). As it was found\nthat members of these castes as a whole were educationally and socially backward, the list which\nhad been coming on from as far back as 1906 was finally adopted for purposes of Art. 15(4). In short\nthe case of the State of Madras is that the castes included in the list are only a compendious\nindication of the class of people in those castes and these classes of people had been put in the list\nfor the purpose of Art. 15(4) because they had been found to be socially and educationally backward.\nThis is the position as explained in the Affidavit filed on behalf of the State of Madras. On the other\nhand the only thing stated in the petitions is that as the list is based on caste alone it is violative of\nArt. 15(1). In view however of the explanation given by the State of Madras, which has not been\ncontroverted by any rejoinder, it must be accepted that though the list shows certain castes, the\nmembers of those castes are really classes of educationally and socially backward citizens.']","The term ""class"" in the context of discrimination and special provisions for advancement of certain groups of citizens, as defined in the State of Andhra Pradesh v P. Sagar case, refers to a homogeneous section of people grouped together based on common attributes such as status, rank, occupation, residence, race, religion, and other similar traits. It emphasizes that while caste cannot be completely excluded in determining a class, a test solely based on caste or community cannot be accepted.

This will enable us to ascertain,\nwhether the practice of talaq has a legislative sanction, because it is the\npetitioner’s case, that it is so through express legislation (-the Muslim\nPersonal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937). But the stance adopted on\nbehalf of those contesting the petitioner’s claim is, that its stature is that of\n‘personal law’, and on that account, the practice of ‘talaq-e-biddat’ has a\nconstitutional protection.\n113.

Even if we agree with the proposition that ‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple\ntalaq constitutes the ‘personal law’ governing Muslims, on the issue of\ndivorce, this Court will still need to examine, whether the practice of\n‘talaq-e-biddat’ – triple talaq, violates the acceptable norms of “… public\norder, morality and health and to the other provisions …” of Part III of the\nConstitution (–for that, is the case set up by the petitioner).

These\nhave been referred to in great detail in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice. In essence, the\npetitioners, supported by the Union of India, state that Triple Talaq is an anachronism in today□s\nday and age and, constitutionally speaking, is anathema. Gender discrimination is put at the\nforefront of the argument, and it is stated that even though Triple Talaq may be sanctioned by the\nShariat law as applicable to Sunni Muslims in India, it is violative of Muslim women□s fundamental\nrights to be found, more particularly, in Articles 14, 15(1) and 21 of the Constitution of India.\nOpposing this, counsel for the Muslim Personal Board and others who supported them, then relied\nheavily upon a Bombay High Court judgment, being State of Bombay v. Narasu Appa Mali, AIR 1952\nBom 84, for the proposition that personal laws are beyond the pale of the fundamental rights\nChapter of the Constitution and hence cannot be struck down by this Court. According to them, in\nthis view of the matter, this Court should fold its hands and send Muslim women and other women□s\norganisations back to the legislature, as according to them, if Triple Talaq is to be removed as a\nmeasure of social welfare and reform under Article 25(2), the legislature alone should do so. To this,\nthe counter argument of the other side is that Muslim personal laws are not being attacked as such.\nWhat is the subject matter of attack in these matters is a statute, namely, the Muslim Personal Law\n(Shariat) Application Act, 1937 (hereinafter referred to as the „1937 Act…). According to them, Triple\nTalaq is specifically sanctioned by statutory law vide Section 2 of the 1937 Act and what is sought for\nis a declaration that Section 2 of the 1937 Act is constitutionally invalid to the aforesaid extent. To\nthis, the Muslim Personal Board states that Section 2 is not in order to apply the Muslim law of\nTriple Talaq, but is primarily intended to do away with custom or usage to the contrary, as the\nnon-obstante clause in Section 2 indicates. Therefore, according to them, the Muslim personal law\nof Triple Talaq operates of its own force and cannot be included in Article 13(1) as „laws in force… as\nhas been held in Narasu Appa (supra).\n3. The question, therefore, posed before this Court is finally in a very narrow compass. Triple Talaq\nalone is the subject matter of challenge ƒ other forms of Talaq are not. The neat question that arises\nbefore this Court is, therefore, whether the 1937 Act can be said to recognize and enforce Triple\nTalaq as a rule of law to be followed by the Courts in India and if not whether Narasu Appa (supra)\nwhich states that personal laws are outside Article 13(1) of the Constitution is correct in law.\n4. Inasmuch as the Muslims in India are divided into two main sects, namely Sunnis and Shias, and\nthis case pertains only to Sunnis as Shias do not recognize Triple Talaq, it is important to begin at\nthe very beginning.\n5. In a most illuminating introduction to Mulla□s Principles of Mahomedan Law (16th Ed.) (1968),\nJustice Hidayatullah, after speaking about Prophet Mahomed, has this to say:\n„The Prophet had established himself as the supreme overlord and the supreme\npreceptor.
