The concern raised is that these clauses, specifically clauses (4) and (5), are arbitrary and do not have any specific law to apply to the case at hand. This lack of a legal framework to guide the decision-making process is seen as a violation of the rule of law, particularly Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination. The argument presented is that the constituent power, in this instance, did not have a law to apply due to the repeal of the previous law, leading to a situation where the validation of the election was not based on any legal foundation. This absence of a legal basis for the decision-making process is considered arbitrary and detrimental to the rule of law, as it exposes individuals to the arbitrary will of the government. The case highlights the importance of having a clear legal framework and adherence to the rule of law in decision-making processes to ensure fairness, equality, and the protection of individual rights.","1.

2. The action should be fair, reasonable, non-discriminatory, transparent, non-capricious, unbiased, without favoritism or nepotism, and promote healthy competition and equitable treatment.
3. Legislation can be struck down if found to be manifestly arbitrary, unfair, unreasonable, discriminatory, non-transparent, capricious, biased, or with favoritism or nepotism.
