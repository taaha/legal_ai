No one has been allowed to so\\nexercise his rights as to impinge upon the rights of others. Although different streams\\nof thought still persist, the later writers have generally taken the view that natural\\nrights have no proper place outside the Constitution and the laws of the state. It is up\\nto the state to incorporate natural rights, or such of them as are deemed essential,\\nand subject to such limitations as are considered appropriate, in the Constitution or\\nthe laws made by it. But independently of the Constitution and the laws of the state,\\nnatural rights can have no legal sanction and cannot be enforced. The courts look to\\nthe provisions of the Constitution and the statutory law to determine the rights of\\nindividuals. The binding force of Constitutional and statutory provisions cannot be\\ntaken away nor can their amplitude and width be restricted by invoking the concept\\nof natural rights. Further, as natural rights have no place in order to be legally\\nenforceable outside the provisions of the Constitution and the statute, and have to be\\ngranted by the Constitutional or statutory provisions, and to the extent and subject to\\nsuch limitations as are contained in those provisions, those rights, having been once\\nincorporated in the Constitution or the statute, can be abridged or taken away by\\namendment of the Constitution or the statute. The rights, as such, cannot be deemed\\nto be supreme or of superior validity to the enactments made by the state, and not\\nsubject to the amendatory process.\\n1510. It may be emphasised in the above context that those who refuse to subscribe to\\nthe theory of enforceability of natural rights do not deny that there are certain\\nessential values in Me, nor do they deny that there are certain requirements\\nnecessary for a civilized existence. It is also not denied by them that there are certain\\nideals which have inspired mankind through the corridor of centuries and that there\\nare certain objectives and desiderata for which men have struggled and made\\nsacrifices. They are also conscious of the noble impulses yearning for a better order of\\nthings, of longings natural in most human hearts, to attain a state free from\\nimperfections where higher values prevail and are accepted. Those who do not\\nsubscribe to the said theory regarding natural rights, however, do maintain that\\nrights in order to be justiciable and enforceable must form part of the law or the\\nConstitution, that rights to be effective must receive their sanction and sustenance\\nfrom the law of the land and that rights which have not been codified or otherwise\\nmade a part of the law, cannot be enforced in courts of law nor can those rights\\noverride or restrict the scope of the plain language of the statute or the Constitution.\\n1511. Willoughby while dealing with the concept of natural rights has observed in Vol.\\nI of Constitution of the United States:\\nThe so-called 'natural' or unwritten laws defining the natural, inalienable, inherent\\nrights of the citizen, which, it is sometimes claimed, spring from the very nature of\\nfree government, have no force either to restrict or to extend the written provisions of\\nthe Constitution. The utmost that can be said for them is that where the language of\\nthe Constitution admits of doubt, it is to be presumed that authority is not given for\\nthe violation of acknowledged principles of justice and liberty.Kesavananda Bharati Sripadagalvaru ... vs State Of Kerala And Anr on 24 April, 1973\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/257876/ 490\", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Having said so, the notions of public order, morality and health cannot be used as colourable\\ndevice to restrict the freedom to freely practise religion and discriminate against women of the age\\ngroup of 10 to 50 years by denying them their legal right to enter and offer their prayers at the\\nSabarimala temple for the simple reason that public morality must yield to constitutional morality.\\nWhether exclusionary practice is an essential practice as per Hindu religion\\n112. We have, in the earlier part of this judgment, determined that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa,\\nwho though claim to be a separate religious denomination, do not, as per the tests laid down by this\\nCourt in several decisions, most prominent of them being S.P. Mittal (supra), constitute a separate\\nreligious denomination within the meaning of Article 26 of the Constitution. This leads us to a\\nmathematical certainty that the devotees of Lord Ayyappa are the followers of Hindu religion. Now,\\nwhat remains to be seen is whether the exclusion of women of the age group of 10 to 50 years is an\\nessential practice under the Hindu religion in the backdrop of the peculiar attending circumstances\\nattributable to the Sabarimala temple. For ascertaining the said question, we first need to\\nunderstand what constitutes an essential practice for a particular religion which has been the\\nsubject matter of several decisions of this Court. Article 25 merely protects the freedom to practise\\nrituals, ceremonies, etc. which are an integral part of a religion as observed by this Court in John\\nVallamattom and another v. Union of India31. While saying so, the Court ruled that a disposition\\ntowards making gift for charitable or religious purpose can be designated as a pious act of a person,\\nbut the same cannot be said to be an integral part of any religion.\\n113. The role of essential practices to a particular religion has been well demonstrated by Lord\\nHalsbury in Free Church of Scotland v. Overtoun32 wherein it was observed:\\n\"In the absence of conformity to essentials, the denomination would not be an entity\\ncemented into solidity by harmonious uniformity of opinion, it would be a mere\\nincongruous heap of, as it were, grains of sand, thrown together without being\\nunited, each of these intellectual and isolated grains differing from every other, and\\nthe whole forming a but nominally united while really unconnected mass; fraught\\nwith (2003) 6 SCC 611 (1904) AC 515 nothing but internal dissimilitude, and mutual\\nand reciprocal contradiction and dissension.\"\\n114. This Court, in Shirur Mutt (supra), for the first time, held that what constitutes an essential part\\nof a religion will be ascertained with reference to the tenets and doctrines of that religion itself. The\\nCourt had opined thus:\\n\"In the first place, what constitutes the essential part of a religion is primarily to be\\nascertained with reference to the doctrines of that religion itself.\"Indian Young Lawyers Association vs The State Of Kerala on 28 September, 2018\\nIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/163639357/ 29', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In determining whether a\\nparticular section forms a class, caste cannot be excluded altogether. But in the determination of a\\nclass a test solely based upon the caste or community cannot also be accepted. By cl. (1) Art. 15\\nprohibits the State from discriminating against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste,\\nsex, place of birth or any of them. By cl. (3) of Art. 15 the State is, notwithstanding the provision\\ncontained in cl. (1), permitted to make special provision for women and children. By cl. (4) a special\\nprovision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for\\nthe Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is outside the purview of cl. (1). But cl. (4) is an\\nexception to cl. (1). Being an exception, it cannot be extended so as in effect to destroy the guarantee\\nof cl. (1). The Parliament has by enacting cl. (4) attempted to balance as against the right of equality\\nof citizens the special necessities of the weaker sections of the people by allowing a provision to be\\nmade for their advancement. In order that effect may be given to cl. (4), it must appear that the\\nbeneficiaries of the special provision are classes which are backward socially and educationally and\\nthey are other that the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and that the provision made is for\\ntheir advancement.\"\\n5.
